Here is a comprehensive breakdown of all the functions that must be implemented for this C++ high-frequency trading system ("Master Mind"), based on your client's full requirement document. These functions are listed in a way that can be directly understood by AI coding tools like Cursor AI, categorized for clarity, and none of the requirements are skipped:

üîß CORE ENGINE FUNCTIONALITY
initialize_strategy(config)
Load user-defined configurations (e.g. capital allocation, trading sessions, tick buffer).

Set up counters and risk management thresholds.

start_trading_session()
Start live or paper trading based on system status.

Respect user-defined market timing (e.g., London or Tokyo session).

shutdown_strategy()
Safely terminate all running operations.

Cancel any pending orders, save audit logs, update counters.

üìà RENKO BRICK DETECTION & SIGNALS
generate_renko_chart(instrument_data)
Construct Renko bricks using traditional method.

Support user-defined brick size.

detect_entry_signal(bricks, setup_type)
Setup 1: Detect two consecutive down bricks + 75% formed up brick.

Setup 2: Detect patterns like Green-Red-Green, Red-Green-Red; identify breakout from high/low channel.

detect_exit_signal(bricks)
Exit based on:

Profit target.

Opposite signal formation.

Stop loss hit.

üí∏ RISK MANAGEMENT & POSITION SIZING
calculate_position_size(capital, risk_percent, stoploss_pips, pip_value)
Formula-driven calculation of order size (e.g., >= 0.01 lots).

should_continue_trading_after_loss(loss_count)
If 2 consecutive losses: switch to paper trading mode.

should_continue_to_next_counter(current_equity, previous_gains_losses)
Only allow next batch of 10 trades if equity improved.

halt_trading_for_day()
Stop trading when daily loss exceeds risk percentage.

üì§ ORDER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (OMS)
place_entry_order(order_type, price, instrument)
Place Buy Stop/Sell Stop based on signal.

Add 2-tick buffer above/below brick close.

cancel_order(order_id)
Cancel orders if conditions no longer valid.

move_stop_to_breakeven(entry_price, tick_buffer)
After 2 favorable bricks, update SL to breakeven + 1‚Äì2 ticks to cover costs.

place_hybrid_order(instrument, direction)
In fast-moving markets (crypto/forex), if order not filled:

Place hybrid of iceberg + pegged order.

trailing_stoploss_manager(trade)
Adjust SL dynamically based on Renko moves and buffer.

üîÑ API INTEGRATIONS
connect_to_exchange(exchange_name, credentials)
Support for Binance, Delta Exchange, Deribit, Coinbase.

Also support MT4/MT5 via bridge or plugin.

get_margin_requirements(instrument)
Pull real-time margin data from broker APIs.

get_swap_charges(instrument)
Retrieve swap charges per asset.

execute_order_via_api(order_object)
Actual placement, modification, or cancellation of orders.

fetch_real_time_data(instrument)
Stream market data with low latency (tick-level).

üß† STRATEGY MODES & LOGIC CONTROLS
toggle_strategy_mode(mode)
Toggle between:

Live trading

Paper trading

Setup 1 / Setup 2 / Both

check_trading_window(current_time)
Confirm if current time falls in allowed trading session.

üßæ AUDIT TRAIL / LOGGING MODULE
log_event(event_type, timestamp, data)
Strategy signal

OMS action (rejected, modified orders)

API call (request/response/error)

Margin/PnL snapshot

store_logs(database_type)
Use SQLite or MongoDB.

Must be write-protected and secure.

üõ†Ô∏è CONFIGURATION MODULE
load_config_from_file(filepath)
JSON/YAML-based config: instruments, capital per asset, risk %, tick buffer.

update_config_live(params)
Hot-reload configuration without restarting system.

üîç MONITORING / DIAGNOSTICS
display_current_status_dashboard()
Show live PnL, capital per counter, losses, gains, active orders.

error_handling_and_recovery(error_code)
Handle API or trading errors gracefully with retries or fallback.

üîê SECURITY & COMPLIANCE
sign_NDA_and_lock_code_access()
Enforce NDA agreement for proprietary access.

Code must not be reused or leaked.

‚úÖ Key Notes for Cursor AI / Coding Environment:
All strategies must be implemented in C++.

Performance-critical: prioritize multithreading, low-latency I/O, and lock-free data structures.

Audit logs must be timestamped, secure, and support offline retrieval.

Risk logic, order placement, and Renko signals must be strictly isolated into modules for testing.

No GUI needed unless specified; use config files and terminal logs for interaction.

Would you like a directory and file structure plan, or should I begin scaffolding the full C++ class-based layout for the system?
